# mqlite Configuration Example
# Copy this file to mqlite.toml and customize as needed

# Environment Variables:
#
# 1. In-file substitution using ${VAR} or ${VAR:-default} syntax:
#    bind = "${MQTT_HOST:-0.0.0.0}:${MQTT_PORT:-1883}"
#    password = "${ADMIN_PASSWORD}"
#
# 2. Override any field with MQLITE__ prefixed env vars (double underscore):
#    MQLITE__SERVER__BIND=0.0.0.0:1884
#    MQLITE__LIMITS__MAX_CONNECTIONS=50000
#    MQLITE__MQTT__MAX_QOS=1
